### Project Overview
This repository contains the code used for the **HED Challenge** by Team 2. Our analysis includes data from the ARCOS data set, the US Census Bureau, and the NIH. In this challenge, we analyzed the impact of Tennessee state policy on the opioid crisis during the time from 2006-2019 and how it relates to health equity. 


### Background
> The HED Challenge aims to explore real-world health datasets, pursue novel research questions related to health equity, and create figures/dashboards to communicate key health data insights to a wide range of audiences. Our approach leverages Tableau visuals and analysis done in R to address the challenge objectives.
